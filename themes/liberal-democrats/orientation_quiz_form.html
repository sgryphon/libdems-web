<h1>Australian Political Quiz</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Australian political quiz - 10 questions that will help you
  determine your political philosophy and where you stand compared with Australian
  political parties. </p>
<p>Your political philosophy will be determined using a 2 dimensional grid. One
  dimension will assess your economic views, ranging from a belief in free markets
  and capitalism to command economies and socialism. The second dimension will
  assess your social views, ranging from a belief in conservative nationalistic
  values to belief in greater civil liberties and social freedoms. </p>
<p>Your views will then be plotted on the below grid:</p>
  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

	  <a href="#communism">What about communism?</a><br>
	  <a href="#conservatism">And conservativism?</a></td>
      <td valign="top"><div class="indented">Five broad political
        philosophies have been identified, including:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Social democracy</strong>. A belief in a mixed economy
            and some level of personal freedom. This describes the current political
            environment in Australia and most of the developed world.</li>
          <li><strong>Liberal democracy</strong>. A belief in a free-market economy
            and in personal freedom. </li>
          <li><strong>Democratic Socialism</strong>. A belief in a command economy
            and personal freedom. </li>
          <li><strong>Free-market conservative</strong>. A belief in a free-market
            economy and conservative social values. </li>
          <li><strong>National Socialism</strong>. A belief in a command economy
            and conservative social values. </li>
        </ul>
      </div></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The quiz includes 5 economic questions and 5 social questions. Each question
    has five possible answers. Based on your answers, you will be placed somewhere
    in the above grid. Also, the policies of Australian political parties have
    been compared with the questions to determine where they stand on the grid. </p>

<div class="main"><em>What about Communism?</em> <em>And Conservativism?</em>
<a name="communism"></a>
<h4>Communism</h4>
<p>When most people refer to communism, they are talking about socialism (command
  economies). This is what existed in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe (though
  most socialists claim that the Soviet Union got it wrong and that socialism
  can work better). </p>
<p>There is a distinct communist and anarcho-syndicalist political philosophy
  separate from socialism. However, communism cannot be adequately represented
  on the political grid used here because of their position on economic issues. </p>
<p>The options given in this quiz are between markets (capitalism, private property
  and voluntary exchange) and government (socialism, public property and government
  redistribution). However, an authentic communist (and anarcho-syndicalist)
  position opposes both the government and the market. Subsequently, they cannot
  be plotted on the political grid. </p>
<p>It is uncertain how communism would coordinate the economy, and this is one
  of the strongest criticisms of communism. Consider the following problem. Communists
  would oppose a voluntary contract between employer and employee and would oppose
  a business trading for profit. However, they oppose the power of government
  to stop such actions. </p>
<p>So would they allow the actions to go ahead - effectively endorsing the market?
  Or would they create an institution with the power to stop such actions - effectively
  creating a government? Strangely, communists say they&#8217;d do neither, but
  they don&#8217;t explain how that would work. </p>
<h4><a name="conservatism"></a>Conservativism</h4>
<p>Conservativism has not been included on the political grid as it is not really
  a political philosophy but is rather a belief that the rate of change should
  be slow, or that institutions that existed yesterday should be preserved.</p>
<p>In Australia today, we live in a social democracy - and so conservatives generally
  support social democracy. 100 years ago we lived in something closer to liberal
  democracy - and back then conservatives generally supported liberal democracy. </p>
<p>That is why conservatives and liberal democrats have traditionally been in
  alliance, against socialists and social democrats. However, this alliance no
  longer makes much sense as conservatives no longer defend liberal democracy. </p>
<p>This understanding of convservativism helps explain why there appears so little
  difference between the major parties. The conservative party in Australia (Liberals)
  used to support the status quo of liberal democracy, while the Labor Party
  believed in social democracy. There was a real difference. However, as Australia
  has becoming a social democracy (most noticably during the 1970s), the Liberals
  have begun defending the new status quo.</p>
<p>Effectively, the Labor party wants social democracy because it believes in
  it, while the Liberals want social democracy because it&#8217;s the status
  quo - and so there is little difference between them. What differences can
  be seen are explained by minority groups in both parties - including democratic
  socialists in the Labor party, and some free-market conservatives and national
  socialists in the Liberal and National party respectively. <br>
